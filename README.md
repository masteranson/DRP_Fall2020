Homotopy continuation is a classical technique in numerical algebraic geometry used to solve for all possible solutions in a non-linear system of algebraic equations. For my [Directed Reading Program][1] final project, I implemented specific type of a simple type of homotopy continuation method, called a ***Total Degree Parameter Homotopy*** in MATLAB.
