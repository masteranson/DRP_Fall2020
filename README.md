# Homotopy Continuation

Homotopy continuation is a classical technique in numerical algebraic geometry that is used to solve for all possible solutions in a non-linear system of algebraic equations. For my final project in the [Directed Reading Program](https://sites.gatech.edu/gtatgt/sample-page/directed-reading-program/), I implemented a very simple type of a homotopy continuation method, called a ***Total Degree Parameter Homotopy*** in MATLAB. My primary reference for this work is based on the textbook written by [Sommese et al](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/5763). More information is included in the accompanied *Description.pdf* document.

I would like to thank my mentor, Tim Duff, for both teaching me both the theory and implementation of homotopy continuation, and inspiring my interest in the crossover between math and science/engineering.
